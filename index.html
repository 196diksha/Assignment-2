                <p>My name is diksha bajpai and I'm from Kanpur.My father's name is Mr. Sudhakar bajpai.I did my graduation in 2021 from DBS college kanpur.
                I hope to become a software engineer one day. My own opinions/thoughts are my strengths and my weaknessses are my my anxiety levels and also my communicatios skills,
                 in which i have to work with that by reading books/newspaper. I'm an honest person and my nature is too friendly. As I love challeges which i have to overcome my loosing fear, I also prefer smart work rather than hard work.
                 I'm very flexible and adaptive person to learning/creating new things>.</p>/
               
                 <p> Landing a good job — one that excites you, challenges you, and that pays well — is not easy,
                 even in today's tight labor market. It can be especially tricky when you're an, ahem, more seasoned, worker and it feels like every company under the sun craves Millennials and Gen Zers.
                According to Lindsay Mustain, a former Amazon recruiter turned career coach, there's only one good age for job searching and that's 35. 
                "Otherwise you're too old and overqualified or you're too young and under-qualified," she said.The very idea stings. And while Mustain is half-joking, there's a germ of truth to her words. Research suggests older people have a tougher time finding a job.
                 One study, which analyzed hundreds of papers by economists, sociologists, and psychologists, found that job seekers over the
 unemployed 5.8 weeks longer than those from the ages of 30 to 49, and 10.6 weeks longer when compared to people 20 to 29. No doubt age bias plays a role, and there are things

            <P> Kanpur or Cawnpur is an industrial city in the central-western part of the state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
                 Founded in 1207, Kanpur became one of the most important commercial and military stations of British India. Kanpur is also the financial capital of Uttar Pradesh. 
                 Nestled on the banks of Ganges River, Kanpur stands as the major financial and industrial centre of North India and also the ninth-largest urban economy in India.
                  Today it is famous for its colonial architecture, gardens, parks and fine quality leather and textile products which are exported mainly to the West.[12][13]

                It is the 12th most populous city and the 11th most populous urban agglomeration in India. Kanpur was an important British garrison town until 1947, when India gained independence. 
                The urban district of Kanpur Nagar serves as the headquarters of the Kanpur Division, Kanpur Range and Kanpur Zone.
                
                With the first woollen mill of India, commonly known as the Lal Imli (literally meaning "Red Tamarind", for a brand produced by the mill) by the British India Corporation established here in 1876 by Alexander MacRobert. 
                The eastern and northern facades of the mill are reminiscent of the Palace of Westminster, due to their architecture, proximity to the Ganges river and with the north-east corner of the mill being topped by a clock tower similar to Big Ben in London. 
                This similarity underscores the city's importance and prestige during the British times, which extends till date; making the Lal Imli — a great highlight of the city. 
                The city is also widely regarded as the "Leather City of the World" and is predominantly nicknamed as the "Manchester of the East", for its chemical, textile and leather industries.
